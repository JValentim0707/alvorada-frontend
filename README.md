## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: Make sure you have Node.js installed. We recommend using `nvm` to manage your Node.js versions.
*   **[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)**: Node Version Manager is a command-line tool for installing and managing Node.js versions.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
    cd your-project
    ```

2.  **Use the correct Node.js version**:
    This project uses a specific Node.js version. Run the following command to ensure you are using the correct one:
    ```bash
    nvm use
    ```
    *(If you don't have the version installed, `nvm` will likely prompt you to install it.)*

3.  **Install dependencies**:
    Install the project's dependencies by running:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can start the development server.
